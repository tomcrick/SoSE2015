\begin{abstract}
In the developed world, two distinct trends are emerging to shake-up
the current dominance of privately-owned, combustion motor car
transport. The first is the emergence of the electric powertrain for
vehicles, and its emergence as an affordable and mass-marketed means
of transport. This carries with it the potential to address many of
the direct short-comings of the current paradigm -- air pollution, CO2
emissions and noise pollution.

The second is the rise of hire models of car ownership -- the concept
of paying for the use of a car as and when you need it. This carries
with it the potential to address many of the systematic short comings
of the current paradigm -- outlay-induced car use, residential parking
and social division.  On a similar timescale, we are witnessing the
rise of smart technologies and smart cities -- concepts that use data
about the state of a system or elements of it to create value.

There have been relatively few examples of schemes that have combined
the electric and hire-model concepts, despite their benefits appear to
dovetail beneficially. Indeed, the majority is against them on both
counts -- cars are predominantly privately-owned and combustion.

\section{Introduction}

The last decade has demonstrated the current Western private transport
paradigm has only a finite life; a transport culture that consists of
overwhelmingly privately-owned internal combustion engine automobiles
is unlikely to survive the next 50 years.

Two distinct cultural trends are bringing about this demise. Most
ostensibly is the emergence of electrical motors as the primary
alternate fuel source in powertrains for automobiles. Almost all of
the world’s major automotive companies have released purpose-designed
electric cars; some have had such strategic investment in the concept
as to release an entire electric car range, such as BMW's i
Series. The direct environmental benefits of electric cars, summarised
as lower particulate emissions, lower noise emissions and the
potential for lower CO2 emissions, have reached the consensus of
being highly significant. Legislation in many countries is acting as a
double-edged blade: penalising ICE users, and incentivising the
purchase of EVs. Electric cars bring with them several caveats,
however: the capital cost of EVs, predominantly due to battery
technology, is yet to be comparable to an equivalent ICE car; the
embodied carbon of EVs, again due to the battery component, is on
average considerably higher than an equivalent ICE, and the generation
of electricity to meet charging patterns brings with it considerable
logistical difficulties.

More in its infancy is the trend of transitions in car use models. In
other modes of private transport, predominantly bike use, an
increasing number of users are opting to participate in short term
hire models of use, particularly in urban contexts. Rather than baring
the capital and logistical cost of owning a bike, individuals hire the
bike for a nominal fee from a given node near their origin, complete
their journey, and return the bike to a node near their
destination. Once seen as radical, demonstrators such as London’s
``Boris Bike'' scheme demonstrated not only the feasibility of the
business model, but also the effacy of the indirect benefits,
illustrated by phenomenal increase in cycling in the city. 

A third, more generalised trend in societal organisation is the
emergence of the smart city theorem. This capitalises on the use of
`smart technologies', systems that harness opportunities data presents
to provide value; in the Smarty City theorem this cuts across city
system boundaries. In other words, the data from one particular
aspect, such as waste disposal, not only informs the operation of
waste disposal, but also, for example, influences how the road system
operates during waste collection hours.

However, transition is, at present, slow. Electric cars only make up a
negligible share of the UK car park, short-term hire transport models
have yet to be proved beyond simpler transport situations, such as
bicycles, and Smart Cities are, at present, little more than a long
term strategic aim, with some instances of demonstrators, most of
which are too early in their lifetime to be able to suggest any real
conclusions. 

The actions of policy makers in the next 10 years will dictate
how much these trends are harnessed, encouraged or ignored, and
ultimately how the UK's transport culture changes as a result.

\subsection{Context}

Politically, the UK’s transport strategy lacks resolve. A heavily
departmentalised, part-privatised transport system lacks consistent
objectives, agendas or priorities. Multimodal travel design is
attempted coarsely, with new transport systems being overlaid on the
old, with little foresight or retrospective adjustment.

Over the last 60 years, transport journey makeup has transitioned
rapidly from a public transport dominated to a private transport
dominated network, stabilising at the end of the 2010 decade. Vocal,
anti-automotive political agendas, global recession and rising oil
prices have all emerged since as powerful, anti-private transport
influences. However, they have done little to reduce private transport
in the wider scale of things, and transport behaviours appear largely
unchanged, tending instead to a marginally lower equilibrium level
today. This is displayed graphically in
Figure~\ref{fig:uktransportshare}, and the corresponding car ownership
trends in Figure~\ref{fig:ukcarsperperson}.

\begin{figure}[!htp]

\caption{Car ownership trends in the UK}
\label{fig:uktransportshare}
\end{figure}

It is apparent that in theory, public transport is both technically
(in terms of emissions per head) and systematically (second-order
effects, such as congestion, social and economic consequences)
superior to private transport. However, it is equally apparent that
the cost of converting a unit percentage of transport users from
private to public transport increases with conversion. For example, to
convert the easiest, first 10\% of users, a network of urban buses and
trains can be run cost effectively and efficiently. The last 10\% of
the population, however, requires an indescribably vast network that
operates incessantly and at obscene frequencies, and is in practice,
impossible. As such, it is clear that there is a fraction of transport
that, for reasons of financial and practical limitations, will always
remain private transport, and that that fraction is not necessarily
`small'. Although it is relatively clear that the UK does not
currently operate at or even near this `minimum' private transport
makeup, acknowledgement that any such unavoidable level exists is not
politically popular.

As such, in Private Transport, there is a logic that any impacts, both
technically and systematically, should be reduced. This is a popular
and high-growth area of research; within the last 20 years, personal
automobile efficiency has improved drastically. Today, alternate
powertrains such as electric motors, more efficient and less polluting
that internal combustion engines, are not only technically viable, but
a key component of many automotive giant’s strategies; the
aforementioned BMW i Series range is a textbook example of heavy
investment in the transition of retail automobiles to EVs. However, it
is clear that drivetrain transitions alone cannot deal with the
systematic drawbacks of private transport, such as congestion, special
requirements of parking and social isolation of the have-cars and
have-nots. Technological suggestions for these problems do exist, such
as driverless, automated cars and PRT schemes, but both are a far cry
from a ready-to-rollout status. Crucially, for every change that
improves the negative impact of Private Transport, or more accurately,
convincingly depicts itself as doing so, Private Transport is
legitimised a little more, and efforts to transfer journeys to Public
Transport are weakened.

Political action is thus limited by a simple catch-22: public
transport is the ideal, but impractical to reach saturation. Private
transport is undesirable, but unavoidable, yet efforts to improve it
also make it more prevalent. Mathematically, you might argue there is
thus an optimum -- a level of improvement of private transport that,
when the reduction in public transport uptake is factored in, results
in the lowest overall impact in the UK’s travel emissions. Whether or
not this thought experiment is a fair simplification, there is a more
logical and pragmatic answer -- that transport strategy should be
considered on a holistic level, and the interaction between private
and public transport held as crucial. There are many more secondary
effects that could also be considered from this first deduction; not
all improvements to private transport reduce public transport uptake
to the same degree; nor is the UK a homogenous mass of two types of
transport user - attempts to penalise private transporters who could
transfer to public transport and don’t, such as through taxation,
frequently damages those who cannot transfer.

Ignorance to these wider relationships, brought about by the
private/public segmentation of both traditional transport strategies
and the segmentation of organisations tasked with dealing with each,
allows these undesirable, unintended consequences to continue to this
day.

\subsection{Electric Vehicles}

Electric vehicles (EVs) can offer an environmentally sustainable
alternative to internal combustion engines (ICEs). EVs are powered by
a battery which is charged through the electricity network. Alongside
reducing carbon emissions, EVs can also improve noise and air quality,
provide savings for consumers and reduce dependency on specific fossil
fuels~\cite{postevs:2010}. It is widely accepted that an alternate
energy source is necessary for the UK transport network in the near
future, and electrification is currently considered the most likely
choice.  The Department for Transport (DfT) predicts that by 2020 we
will have 1.5 million EVs on the road in the UK~\cite{dft:2008}.

There are a number of barriers to the adoption of EVs. Many of these
are psychological, for example range anxiety; consumers worry that
they may `run out of juice'~\cite{oflev:2011}. However, 95\% of all
vehicle journeys in Great Britain are less than 25
miles~\cite{oflev:2011}, only a small proportion of existing EV's
range. Other consumer barriers include; worries over battery
lifetimes, the risk associated with investing in a relatively new
technology and the current, comparatively large capital investment
required to purchase an EV.

Personal vehicles and small commercial vehicles account for 13\% of
all UK carbon emissions~\cite{lumsden:2012}, by transitioning to EVs
in these sectors, the overall volume of emissions could be
significantly reduced.  Due to the nature of UK car culture, fleet
vehicles accounted for 63\% of all new vehicle sales in the UK in 2011
and as such are a dominant influence on the type of cars for sale in
the used market~\cite{fleets:2012}. There is a growing trend for EVs
in fleet vehicles, so it is likely a tangible used EV market will be
in existence in the next five years.

Electrified public transport is still a fairly new area of
interest. Hybrid buses have been introduced in a number of cities to
reduce emissions, with London having 368 hybrid diesel-electric buses
in operation in 2014~\cite{tfl:2009}. In January 2014, the first
inductive charging all electric buses (EBs) were introduced into
service in Milton Keynes~\cite{bbcnews:2014}. The UK Government is
supporting investment in low carbon bus technology through the Green
Bus fund, as well as many other general, sustainability-targeted
funding packages.

\subsection{Smart Technologies}

Smart technology is a new and rapidly growing concept. As such, a
consensus of its exact definition has yet to be reached. However,
interviewed academics~\cite{elecgen:2013}, industrial
experts~\cite{buscher:2014} and a number of
papers~\cite{komninos:2002,arup-et-al:2011,harrison+abbottdonnelly:2011,batty-et-al:2012}
identify the fundamental, unifying theme as the use of data. The rise
of interest in data-based possibilities for the built environment has
been fuelled by three key developments:

\begin{compactenum}
\item {\textbf{The rapid increase in the production of data.}}
  Computer scientists have stated that many social trends, such as the
  rise internet connectivity, specifically mobile internet
  connectivity, and social networking, has caused an exponential
  increase in the production of data. Today, almost 30 petabytes of
  data exists on Facebook alone\footnote{\url{http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/feb/04/facebook-in-numbers-statistics}}. The mass abundance of such a
  resource has spurred consideration as to its potential use.
\item {\textbf{The rapid increase in the ability to collect specific
      data.}} Improvements in sensor and communication technology have
  meant installing data collection devices is now financially and
  spatially practical. This has led to the development of many
  concepts. Firstly, mesh networks, the notion of deploying equally
  spaced sensors across a large area to give a high resolution of data
  or the ability to track the movement of entities. Secondly, the
  Internet of Things, the notion that with the deployment of
  connected sensors on existing everyday objects, interactions that
  are currently machine-human-machine could simply be machine-machine,
  allowing many such processes to be faster, cheaper and  more
  convenient. 
\item {\textbf{Improvements in data storage and processing.}} Due to
  Moore’s Law, storage is far cheaper than ever before allowing
  this vast data to be stored. Processing power is also much greater,
  allowing complex trends from data on scales so vast as a city to be
  processed and actioned fast enough to be considered `live'.
\end{compactenum}

Many such sources refer to data as a raw material, creating the notion
that data can and should be used as an input to a business model that
is then translated to value. In recent years the practicalities of
collecting and processing a vast quantity of high value data of a
system, as discussed, has developed
significantly~\cite{arup-et-al:2011}. Such a system could be a
business, city, or house, with data being the movement of containers
in a factory, the journeys of cars across an urban centre, or the use
of electricity residentially. The sheer volume of data available for
such a large range of systems has led to the term `Big Data’, now
commonly used to refer to a data stream large enough to make smart
technologies
feasible~\cite{hollands:2008,ibmsmartcities:2009,ciscoconcities:2010}.

Smart technologies are usually defined as microsystems within these
larger systems that carry out an action based on the collected
data. Smart technologies are typically based on an existing action
that, it is theorised, could be completed more effectively -- as well
as sustainably~\cite{cosgrave-et-al:2014} -- with the assistance of
data~\cite{arup-et-al:2011}. More effectively can be interpreted as:

\begin{compactitem}
\item {\textbf{Faster:}} such as using traffic distribution to update
  signs in real time, rather than the extremely slow, reactive methods
  by which traffic is informally advised against taking certain
  routes.
\item {\textbf{Fairer:}} such as smart pricing for grid electricity,
  whereby data on the national grid demand is used to charge those who
  use electricity when demand is highest (when the cost of generation
  is highest) a cost that is reflective of the cost to supply the
  electricity to them. 
\item {\textbf{At lower cost:}} whereby flow sensors in water pipes
  can be used to deduce the exact location of leaks when they emerge,
  rather than expensive inspections.
\item {\textbf{Without human interaction:}} whereby more interactions
  can be machine-machine rather than using a human intermediary, such
  as when an inspection robot is automatically sent to the site of a
  machine malfunction in a factory, rather than human noticing the
  fault and piloting the robot manually. This can improve instances of
  both human error, hesitation and subjective judgment, for better or
  for worse. 
\end{compactitem}

Smart cities are cities where smart technologies are taken a step
further, and different city sub-systems such as waste disposal and
water provision are integrated. In practice, this results in smart
technologies using data streams from neighbouring
systems~\cite{shapiro:2006}. For example, in a theoretical world where
there is near saturation of EVs, preemptive car journey data could be
used to adjust the grid’s generation so as to ensure the correct
amount of power is generated for the EVs recharging at the time they
are expected home. Such foresight allows for more efficient generation
and an avoidance of wasteful, short-notice generation that is
currently employed~\cite{tsoukalas:2008}.

\section{The Role of Smart Technology}

\subsection{Methodology}

We will now consider the role of smart technology within the future’s
transport strategy, specifically integrated private/public and
electric transport solutions For a range of suggested concepts in
existing literature covering smart technologies of a number of
different industries, we will consider the nature and operation of
each in the wider smart transport context.

% The financial value data can bring is typically categorised into three
% main types as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:datavaltechniques}:

% \begin{figure*}[!htp]
% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/datavaltechniques.png}
% \caption{Data Valuation Techniques in a three scale model}
% \label{fig:datavaltechniques}
% \end{figure*}

Throughout this exploration, an appropriate valuation method will be
chosen depending on the nature of the technology in question. For each
example we will speculate the first year value of the technology,
commenting on the total lifetime value later on.

For the purposes of this study we will consider the benefits of these
Smart Technologies specifically from a private sector business case
viewpoint; that is to say, primarily the financial and economic
benefit they could bring. Many have significant social, political and
environmental benefits that will not be detailed herein, but
considered in overview in the Analysis section.

\subsection{Cars}

Standard car hire industry practice is to operate a maintenance regime
that involves inspection above the recommended frequency, designed to
reduce the time between inspections when the car may suffer from a
freak failure. Freak failures are defined as those whereby there was
no indication at the last inspection that the car would fail before
the next testing.

Using health and usage monitoring sensors attached to key components
in the car, the car hire operators can get an understanding of level
of car mechanical state close to that offered by an inspection, only
constantly and in real time. This could drastically reduce the rate of
freak failures and, if the sensor coverage was sufficient enough,
potentially allow cut backs in human servicing.  This concept is
already well understood in industrial contexts and frequently
realised. The value from this system comes from improved reliability
of the car hire service.

% \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/carmaintenancevt.png}
% \caption{Car maintenance value tree}
% \label{fig:carmaintenancevt}
% \end{figure}


\subsection{Live Air Quality Management}

At present, Bristol monitors air quality by semi-permanent
installations at specific areas around the city.  In a typical UK
urban environment, particularly one with no significant industry, air
quality is primarily governed by the emissions of road transport.  As
such, if it was possible to understand the overall distribution of
vehicles in the city at any one point in time, it would be possible to
estimate, with relative accuracy, the air quality throughout the
entire city. At present, in some areas of the city, car flow is
monitored by car-recognising cameras. These however are sparse and
expensive to install.

The car hire EVs are likely to use the same roads to the same
intensity of other cars on the road at that time. In other words,
their road routing behaviour is likely to be very similar, if not
identical, to the rest of the cars on the road at that time. As such,
a critical resolution of hire cars is necessary to deduce an estimate
of the wider car resolution. We will examine critical resolutions in
detail at the end of this section.  The value from this system comes
from the created market of vending car locational data to Bristol City
Council.

% \begin{figure}[!htp]
% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/dontchokebristol.png}
% \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/airqualityvt.png}
% \caption{Air quality value tree}
% \label{fig:airqualityvt}
% \end{figure}

\subsection{Live Accident Reporting}

Similar to in-car monitoring for maintenance, vehicles can also be
fitted with impact sensors, altering the car hire management that a
car has suffered a serious crash, allowing them to contact the
authorities.  Due to the significant improvement in road safety mobile
phones have already awarded road transport since the mid-2000s, and
the relative rarity of isolated crashes, it is unlikely the value case
here can be made from a practical improvement in fatality rates from
car hire use.

Instead, it is probable that the main benefit of such a system would
be perceptual – improved piece of mind for the customer that a system
will be in place to constantly evaluate their safety.  As can be
observed, the increase in service from such a technology yields a
relatively insignificant revenue stream.

% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/liveaccidentvc.png}
% \caption{Live accident reporting value chain}
% \label{fig:liveaccidentvc}
% \end{figure}

\subsection{User Journey Data}

One of the fastest growing appreciations of data is within retail and
leisure industries.  Many organisations using big data have shown that
advertisement conversion rates (the percentage of individuals who act
on an advertisement they have seen) can be greatly increased by
accurate targeting of the advert to the correct
recipient. Traditionally, this would be done by geographical area or
age group. More recently however, with the ability to better express
to the world your other preferences and personal situation through
social media networks, it is possible to advertise to people of a
specific relationship status, group affiliation or fans of similar
services. Spotify and Facebook are prime examples of how specific
demographic, geographic and chronological conditions are set to not
only able to return high conversion rates, and thus, expensive
advertising to customers, but also, as a result, able to vend smaller
advertising exposures as a tangible product. This means a greater
number of clients, and thus a more resilient business model.

In the car hire, two potential avenues of value creation are possible.
Firstly, information on the journeys of car hire individuals alongside
the time they drive and their personal characteristics, could be
vended in a data package to companies in retail and leisure
industries. These companies would have otherwise had to undertake
expensive customer research, thus the value is clear.

However, this is very likely to suffer from extremely low consent
rates, as it would perhaps be the most invasive form of personal data
harvesting currently in existence. Alternatively, consent rates may
well be much higher if the data was instead used to form targeted
advertising at point of booking. This way, organisations could offer
discounts to individuals it feels it may be able to convert to using
their business on the trip, incentivising them to consent to the
scheme. Furthermore, this could be done dynamically through the
typical kind of advanced display systems that are becoming more common
in today’s automobiles. The revenue stream here will be two fold – the
advertising organisations will pay for the in-car advertising rights,
and individuals would be more inclined to travel through the hire car
if special offers would be available.  The primary value from this
system comes from the vending of targeted, data-based advertising of
in-car and pre-booking advertisement to local businesses.

% \begin{figure}[!htp]
% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/smartmarketingvc.png}
% \caption{Smart marketing value chains}
% \label{fig:smartmarketingvc}
% \end{figure}

\subsection{Smart Pricing Congestion Control}

An alternate method to control congestion is to bring economic forces
to bare on when an individual chooses to travel. In practice, the car
hire smart pricing would include an additional influence based on the
expected congestion of the roads at point of travel, attempting to
deter travel that would exacerbate the congestion.  Ultimately, this
requires the highest critical resolution of hire cars of all the smart
technologies addressed here, by some margin, perhaps at least
25\%. Furthermore, many ethical dilemmas exist. If the resolution is
lower than 50\%, it might be extremely unpopular that the most
sustainable cars are essentially `taxed' into staying off the roads,
while the unsustainable private transport is free to do as it wishes.

Although such a pricing technique would not be unlike current train
pricing structures, the freedom to use a car when one desires is
heavily ingrained in Western society, and it’s likely any such pricing
on that logic would need to be mild. As before, it is difficult to
model the exact effect of taking some cars off the road. As such, the
following value case will be for the theorised time savings, from
speed improvements, exclusively from the AM peak in Bristol.

% \begin{figure}[!htp]
% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/smartpricingcc.png}
% \caption{Smart pricing congestion control}
% \label{fig:smartpricingcc}
% \end{figure}

\subsection{Charging Habits}

Similar to the understanding of how individuals operate electric cars,
the National Grid are very interested in how individuals charge their
EVs, as this will heavily influence how the grid develops in the next
50 years.  Although typically our EV's have predetermined charging
patterns, EVs that are taken on multi-day rentals will most likely
require charging of the hiree’s instigation. This provides a valid
insight into the charging habits of EV users. The value from this
system comes from the created market of vending charging habits to The
National Grid.

% \begin{figure}[!htp]
% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/charginghabitsvt.png}
% \caption{Charging habits value tree}
% \label{fig:charginghabitsvt}
% \end{figure}


\subsection{Car Positional Data}

One of the issues with an electric car hire scheme, as discussed
previously, is the increased layover time incurred by charging. This
has been shown to be manageable in its standard incarnation, but
certain instances could exacerbate this weakness, or simply be a
problem for car hire management schemes in general. For example the
following situations within a booking could threaten the ability to
service later bookings:

\begin{compactenum}
\item {\textbf{Inclement driving conditions:}} EVs are susceptible to
  have sizeable variation of energy use per mile depending on driving
  conditions. Cold weather can have negative effects on electric
  torque. Additionally, heaters in EVs are unable to use the waste
  heat that a combustion car generates, so additional power from the
  battery is required; as much as 15\% in some circumstances. Live
  battery data can allow the car hire management system to know the
  exact power use of a journey.
\item {\textbf{Congestion:}} Traffic can significantly decrease the
  efficiency of the EV. Although the effect is lessened when compared
  to a combustion car as EV engine can turn off and on
  seamlessly. More significantly congestion greatly increases the
  journey time. Car speed data and GPS location data can inform the
  booking management system when a car is stuck in traffic.
\item {\textbf{Sat Nav:}} If an individual decides to take a longer
  route home, or even a route of the same duration of time but a
  greater use of charge (such as a longer motorway route compared to a
  slower trunk route). Live sat nav data can inform the booking
  management system the minute the drive has this intention. 
\end{compactenum}

Pre-warning of any of these unforeseen circumstances can allow
immediate shifting of the booking system to reflect increased hire
duration or increased charging duration. This will prevent people
booking in a time when the car will now be driving/charging. The value
from this system comes from improved reliability of the car hire
service.

\subsection{Barriers and Enablers}

Each of these data streams and their associated benefits require
capital and operational expenditure to put in place the infrastructure
and staff that would facilitate the systems. Even without estimating
this, it can be seen that a number of technologies are immediately
unable to be financially viable, at least in isolation. Needless to
say, this theoretical value is not instantly realisable. Considerable
barriers exist to not only the creation of the value, but also the
smart technologies themselves. At present legislation around
renewables and EVs is under general scrutiny and review. Feed in
tariffs (FITs) and other payouts for balancing services are
complicated and have questionable longevity and there is little
governmental impetus in the UK for smart pricing on a balancing
level. Considerable psychological inertia also exists in some
businesses as to the idea of data as a source of value.  The issue of
critical resolution is also present --
Figure~\ref{fig:bristolcardensity} demonstrates varying accuracy from
predicting traffic levels at different sensor prevalence.

  congestion from EV cars in Bristol, UK}

\end{figure}


\section{Conclusions} 

\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/sankey.png}
\caption{A Sankey diagram of the data value and confidence, along with
  single site vs. multisite implementations}
\label{fig:sankey}
\end{figure}

It is clear there is great variation in the nature and quantity of
value in smart technologies with short term EV hire. These can be seen
graphically in Figure~\ref{fig:sankey}. As a general rule, there are
three categories: 

\begin{compactitem}
\item Firstly, those that have the greatest benefit but are also the
  most speculative, having the highest critical masses and requiring
  the greatest stakeholder buy-in. However, their benefit is
  extreme. These also have the highest quantity of non-financial
  benefit, typically environmental, which is often equivalent to, or
  in some cases higher than the economic and financial benefits. These
  are typified by the smart pricing congestion control and the dynamic
  traffic routing. Although there is little probability that this
  group will be implemented in the near future, the sheer potential
  cannot be ignored, and would serve well as a long term agenda for
  local council, be it with implementation through the hub or
  elsewhere.
\item Secondly, a middle group, with moderate benefit whose
  speculation is somewhat less, but typically relies on a small, niche
  market for vending, and as such hinges significantly on this for any
  value at all. Driving styles is a typical examples of this. While
  there is some variation in the group -- spin off elements such as the
  journey data, advertising approach fairs much better -- it is
  difficult to label these as a quality. How UK law changes with respect
  to data use, as well as how contract culture changes with respect to
  data transactions will have a great influence. Many local
  governments or devolved city regions, including Bristol, are
  aspiring to wider open data initiatives, a
  system where similar data sets are freely available (and reusable),
  and the data is
  realised through the new businesses that open as a result. This
  stands, at least in some lights, in contrast to this category’s
  technologies. 
\item Thirdly, and bucking the trend, is a group with moderate
  benefit, but whose speculation is low and requires only internal
  participation. This third group, typified by the smart pricing and
  car component monitoring, stand out as having the greatest
  appeal.

Ultimately, there is considerable potential for smart technologies to
transform not only the profitability of short term EV hire schemes,
but the wider societal benefit of the concept. Which of the above
segments are most appropriate to focus on will depend on the exact
context and buy-in from external stakeholders. It is equally apparent,
however, that the world has some considerable catching up to do --
socio-culturally, legislatively and psychologically -- if any of these
concepts are to be easily implemented, let alone the concept of the
short-term EV and its benefits thriving across the globe.
